# Project Headshot

Welcome to Project Headshot! This project integrates a React frontend with a Python backend to provide advanced face detection and head tracking capabilities. The system uses OpenCV for real-time image processing and tracking.

## Overview

Project Headshot features a modern web interface built with React for the frontend, while the backend, developed in Python, leverages OpenCV to perform face detection and head tracking. Both components work together seamlessly to deliver a comprehensive facial recognition system.
