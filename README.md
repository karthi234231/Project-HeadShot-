# Project Headshot

Welcome to Project Headshot! This project integrates a React frontend with a Python backend to provide advanced face detection and head tracking capabilities. The system uses OpenCV for real-time image processing and tracking.

## Overview

Project Headshot features a modern web interface built with React for the frontend, while the backend, developed in Python, leverages OpenCV to perform face detection and head tracking. Both components work together seamlessly to deliver a comprehensive facial recognition system.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Python with OpenCV

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in real-time.
- **Head Tracking:** Tracks head movements and positions within detected faces.
- **Responsive Interface:** The React frontend provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Immediate feedback through real-time video analysis.

## Running the Project

To run Project Headshot locally, you need to start both the frontend and backend servers. Follow these steps:

### Frontend (React)
